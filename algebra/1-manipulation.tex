		\item Solve for $x$.
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item $2x+1=5$
			\item $-x+3=10$
			\item $x-y=3$
			\item $5x+3=-17$
			\item $3(x+1)=9$
			\item $\dfrac{10}{x}+2=7$\\
			\item $x+y+z=180$
			\item $4x-3=2x+7$

		\item Billy loves playing Hearthstone. Today Blizzard offers a deal where each player who buys at least one card pack gets three packs for free. Each pack costs \$4, and Billy has \$36 to spend today. How many card packs can Billy get in total today?
		
		\item Suppose that $\triangle ABC$ and $\triangle DEF$ are similar. That is,
		\[\frac{AB}{DE}=\frac{BC}{EF}=\frac{CA}{FD}.\]
		Suppose that $AB=6$, $BC=8$, $CA=10$, and $EF=12$. Find $DE$ and $FD$.
		
		\item Jim is on a road trip. He drives for $x$ hours at 80 km/h and $y$ hours at 100 km/h. In total, he drives for $z$ km. (Recall that $\text{distance}=\text{speed}\times\text{time}$.)
		\begin{enumerate}
			\item Express $z$ in terms of $x$ and $y$.
			\item Suppose $x=3$ and $z=540$. Solve for $y$.
		\end{enumerate}
		
		\item Four years ago David was twice as old as his sister Emily. David is 18 years old now. How old is Emily?
